# HiggsBoson


## Info about the dataset 
- Taken from kaggle 
- It has two files 
  1) Training 
  2) Testing 


## Basic Variable description given
* all variables are floating point, except PRI_jet_num which is integer
* variables prefixed with PRI (for PRImitives) are “raw” quantities about the bunch collision as measured by the detector.
* variables prefixed with DER (for DERived) are quantities computed from the primitive features, which were selected by the physicists of ATLAS
* it can happen that for some entries some variables are meaningless or cannot be computed; in this case, their value is −999.0, which is outside the normal range of all variables
